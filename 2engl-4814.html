            <h2>What is Developing Intelligent Content?</h2>
            <p>I probably should not be publicly picking favorites, but this is the class I was most looking forward to over the summer and that did not change once classes had started. This is my first (and most entertaining) of three classes in Shanks 360. I started working with VS Code and GitHub about a year ago through my internship with the Cyber Range, so I was very excited to learn that we would be utilizing both these tools in class. This course is about learning how to create online content, and boy is it fun! We will spend the semester looking at markup language, content structuring, metadata, and the successful creation of adaptive content. By the end of the semester, I will have a resume in website form that I am very excited to create!</p>

            <h2>Who is Carlos Evia?</h2>
            <p>Carlos Evia is easily the most engaging and entertaining professor I have ever had. Professor Evia has a Ph.D. in technical communication and rhetoric from Texas Tech University, a masterâ€™s in Computer Systems from Universidad La Salle in Mexico City, and a B.A. in communication from the Institue of Social Sciences of Merida in Mexico. His research interests are intelligent content, content strategy, content operations, technical and professional communication, and workplace safety communication. Professor Evia also has quite a few publications. He wrote a book titled <em>Creating Intelligent Content with Lightweight DITA</em> in 2018 and has been named in a plethora of published journal articles. However, with all of this in mind, the most important information to know about Professor Evia is that he is, in fact, a swiftie.</p>
