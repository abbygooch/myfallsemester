            <h2>What is Grants Proposals and Reports?</h2>
            <p>I’m going to be very honest and open here for a minute… I have absolutely zero interest in writing, analyzing, or any other application of grants, proposals, and reports. This class is an option as an elective for the Professional and Technical Writing minor, and it just so happened to fit perfectly into my schedule (and by perfectly, I mean this is my third consecutive class in Shanks 360). Do I have regrets? Maybe. Am I making the most of the class regardless? Absolutely. I was pleasantly surprised to find out though that while the class is primarily focused on grants, there is also a strong focus on developing skills in audience analysis, problem-solving, document design, and collaboration by tackling a range of communication situations and tasks. Throughout the semester I will be working on my own mock proposal, which will serve as my final project at the end of the semester. I may not be having the most fun, but I am broadening my professional and technical skillset!</p>

            <h2>Who is Jim Dubinksy?</h2>
            <p>This semester is my first time taking a class with Jim Dubinksy, and his passion for the professional and technical writing (PTW)  program is extremely evident. Dr. Dubinksy actually founded the PTW major at Virginia Tech and also assisted in creating the first liberal arts Ph.D at Tech in rhetoric and writing. Dr. D has a Ph.D from Miami University, an M.A. from the University of California, Berkeley, and a B.A. from Wake Forest University. He also founded the Center for Student Engagement and Community (now VT-Engage). Dr. Dubinksy’s research interests include scholarship of teaching, professional and technical communication, and veterans in society. In 2004 he published a book called <em>Teaching Technical Writing</em> and has been named in many published journal articles. It is very clear where Dr. Dubinsky’s academic interests lie.</p>
