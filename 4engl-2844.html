            <h2>What is Intro to Professional and Technical Writing?</h2>
            <p>Intro to Professional and Technical Writing is exactly what it sounds like: an introduction to professional and technical writing. This is my second consecutive class in Shanks 360 on Tuesdays/Thursdays! I do wish I had taken this course earlier since it very closely resembles the Communication Skills course I had to take my entire freshman year, but my experience in the subject matter has made it pretty easy thus far. Essentially, the goal of the course is to be able to create, analyze, and collaborate on professional documents. We're doing a lot of work with memos, surveys, and other kinds of professional writing and eventually will complete a group project on advocacy. While this is definitely not my favorite class this semester, it is also not my least favorite.</p>

            <h2>Who is Jim Dubinksy?</h2>
            <p>This semester is (still) my first time taking a class with Jim Dubinksy, and his passion for the professional and technical writing (PTW)  program is extremely evident. Dr. Dubinksy actually founded the PTW major at Virginia Tech and also assisted in creating the first liberal arts Ph.D at Tech in rhetoric and writing. Dr. D has a Ph.D from Miami University, an M.A. from the University of California, Berkeley, and a B.A. from Wake Forest University. He also founded the Center for Student Engagement and Community (now VT-Engage). Dr. Dubinksy’s research interests include scholarship of teaching, professional and technical communication, and veterans in society. In 2004 he published a book called <em>Teaching Technical Writing</em> and has been named in many published journal articles. It is very clear where Dr. Dubinsky’s academic interests lie.</p>
