        <h1>Creating User Documentation</h1>
        <p>Professor: Dr. Sidouane Patcha Lum</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>What is Creating User Documentation?</h2>
            <p>Creating User Documentation is a completely asynchronous course. In all honesty, I did not have even the slightest idea what this course would be about until the first day of classes. Upon opening the canvas page, I learned that it is work that I am very familiar with as an advertising major. This class is primarily about learning how to communicate messages to diverse audiences. Throughout this course, we will be working with user documentation in the form of procedures, processes, and narratives, and developing skills with the technical tools used to create them. This class has been a lot of fun for me so far! I work a lot with the online knowledge bases for my internship, so I feel like I had a little bit of a leg up with creating efficient user documentation.</p>

            <h2>Who is Dr. Patcha Lum?</h2>
            <p>Dr. Sidouane Patcha Lum is a fantastic professor. This is actually my second time taking one of her classes, both of which have been asynchronous, and both times I have felt that she does a great job of managing classes that are completely online. Dr. Patcha Lum has a Ph.D. in rhetoric and composition from the University of Texas at El Paso, an M.S. in rhetoric and technical communication from Michigan Technological University, and a B.Sc. in journalism and mass communication from the University of Buea in Cameroon, West Africa. She is very interested in research, specifically in user experience, visual methodologies, first-year composition, participatory action research, technical and professional writing, cultural rhetorics, and feminism. Her interest in research has also led to several academic research publications.</p>
