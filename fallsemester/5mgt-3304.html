            <h2>What is Management Theory & Leadership Practice?</h2>
            <p>I am not 100% sure what led me to take this class, but I have absolutely no regrets about it. As a freshman I was convinced I would minor in business, so I always appreciate a little business/management action in my schedule. This class is completely asynchronous and is essentially just about learning the fundamentals of management. While we haven’t really gotten into the juicy stuff yet, I am already thoroughly enjoying our assigned reading and I know it will only get better. As of right now, it’s just learning the types and functions of management, but soon we will get into business ethics, organizational improvement, and other more exciting management-related topics. I’m pretty much always going to like an asynchronous class, and this is no exception.</p>

            <h2>Who is Ashley Beleny?</h2>
            <p>This is my first time taking a class with Ashley Beleny, who is an adjunct professor here at Tech and at the Middlebury Institute in International Studies, where she works on international trade-related master's courses. Professor Beleny has an MBA and master's from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in international trade policy, and a B.A. from Ohio State University in international relations. She led Pamplin’s China study abroad program with the Chinese Language Institute in 2018, which was very fitting for her as she used to live in China. While living there, she consulted for United States and European businesses on logistic operations and supply chain management.</p>
