            <h2>What is Marketing Communications?</h2>
            <p>Marketing Communications is much like every other marketing class I have taken so far at Tech, but I am not disappointed by it. While I am pretty convinced that large-scale marketing is not really what I want to do post-graduation, I am still interested in learning about it. This class dissects the theory and application of an organization’s marketing communications, and while it’s mostly lectures, we watch a lot of older ads that are sometimes shocking. It is really interesting to learn about what has worked, not worked, and even changed the game of marketing in the past. This is unfortunately my only class with traditional midterms and exams, but since the content is interesting to me, I don’t think I will have any problems with that.</p>

            <h2>Who is Abdul Al Jumaily?</h2>
            <p>Abdul Al Jumaily is another professor who I have had before, and I enjoy this course as much as I did the one I took with him sophomore year. Professor Jumaily completed his graduate studies at the University of Notre Dame, has an MFA from the University of Kentucky, and a bachelor's degree from the University of Nebraska. He also spent some time at the Mendoza College of Business where he served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for an MBA Brand Strategy course, which focused on the marketing of durable goods and products. Professor Jumaily’s areas of interest in terms of research include consumer behavior, brand management, and advertising. Here at Tech, he leads a study abroad program in Dubai that focuses on business and culture in marketing.</p>
